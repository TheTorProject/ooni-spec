<h1>Bob's example quality test spec!</h1>
<h1></h1>
<h1>Test description</h1>
<p>Describe what operations are done on the input to produce the output.<br />
Implementation details that could potentially affect the end result should also<br />
be mentioned here.</p>
<h1>Expected output</h1>
<h2>Parent data format</h2>
<p>This is the base data format(s) that this test will adhere to (it is<br />
implicit that it will follow df-000-base).</p>
<h2>Required output data</h2>
<p>This is data that should be part of the base dataformat without which the<br />
test cannot properly be interpreted.</p>
<h2>Data specification version number</h2>
<p>Question: Isn't this implicit in the test specification number, is there a reason<br />
why we should have two versions one for the data format and one for the<br />
test specification? Would changing the dataformat not imply changing the<br />
test version number?</p>
<h2>Semantics</h2>
<p>List the extra keys that will be part of the report that are not part of<br />
the parent data format. Be sure not to have keys that clash with the<br />
parent data format.</p>
<h2>Possible conclusions</h2>
<p>Based on the ouput data what conclusions can you draw?</p>
<h2>Example output sample</h2>
<h2>Expected Post-processing efforts</h2>
<p>Question: What exactly is meant by this? Is this meaning the possible<br />
difficulties that a person doing post-processing may encouter?</p>
<h1>Privacy considerations</h1>
<p>There are a few!</p>
<h1>Packet capture considerations</h1>
<p>We capture all packets on the interface foo for bar units of time.</p>
