# Specification version number

0.1.0

# Specification name

Lantern Test

# Test preconditions

Downloaded or compiled the "lantern" binary and made executable and in
the users PATH environment variable.

# Expected impact

Ability to measure whether Lantern is working from the given network vantage point.

# Expected inputs

None

# Test description

This test launches Lantern in --headless mode, and parses output to determine
if it has bootstrapped.  After bootstrap, it fetches a URL using Lanterns HTTP
proxy interface listening on 127.0.0.1.8787 and checks to see if the response
body matches the expected result.
As a URL for testing we use http://www.google.com/humans.txt and look for the
string "Google is built by a large" in the response body.

The specific string used to determine bootstrap from Lantern output in version
"2.0.10" is "Successfully dialed via" from standard output.

# Expected output

## Parent data format

None.

## Required output data

success:
**boolean** The bootstrap status of Lantern (success or failure).

lantern --headless:
**dictionary** the parent key of Lanterns output that contains the keys stdout and stderr

stdout:
**string** Output produced by Lanterns standard output.

stderr:
**string** Error produced by Lanterns standard error.

body:
**string** The page body of a successful HTTP request.

failure:
**string** If failure, then the corresponding failure message.


## Data specification version number

## Semantics

'success' - True or False - whether Lantern has bootstrapped.
'body' - http page body if successfully requested.
'failure' - optional, present if there is a failure.
'lantern --headless':
  'stdout' - Contents of standard output produced by Lantern.
  'stderr' - Contents of standard error produced by Lantern.
'default_configuration' - True or False - whether it is using the default, sane, configuration or not

## Possible conclusions

We can determine whether or not Lantern is able to bootstrap, according to its output.
We can determine whether or not a URL is reachable via Lantern.

## Expected Post-processing efforts

You should be aware of the `default_confguration` parameter as the user may
have misconfigured the test leading to inconsistent results.

# Privacy considerations

Lantern does not seek to provide anonymity. Lantern contains tracking analytics
software and may connect directly to Lantern-provided proxy endpoints, or use
fronted domains via Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) as a data channel.

# Packet capture considerations

This test does not capture packets by default.
