# Specification name

OpenVPN Test

# Test preconditions

Have OpenVPN installed and configured to work with at least one server and privileges to run the test as root.

# Expected impact

Ability to measure whether OpenVPN is working from the given network vantage point.

# Expected inputs

A single URL to fetch, supplied by command line argument "--url (-u)".
OpenVPN configuration file, specified by the command line argument "--openvpn-config (-c)"

# Test description

This test first launches OpenVPN and parses output to determine if it has bootstrapped. After bootstrap, it fetches the  URL specified by the --url argument using OpenVPN.

The specific string used to determine bootstrap from OpenVPN output in version
"0.0.1" is "Initialization Sequence Completed" from standard output.

# Expected output

## Parent data format

None.

## Required output data

success:
**boolean** The bootstrap status of OpenVPN (success or failure).

OpenVPN_linux --headless:
**dictionary** the parent key of OpenVPNs output that contains the keys stdout and stderr

stdout:
**string** Output produced by OpenVPNs standard output.

stderr:
**string** Error produced by OpenVPNs standard error.

body:
**string** The page body of a successful HTTP request.

failure:
**string** If failure, then the corresponding failure message.

## Data specification version number

## Semantics

```
'success' - True or False - whether OpenVPN has bootstrapped.
'body' - http page body if successfully requested.
'failure' - optional, present if there is a failure.
'l/usr/sbin/openvpn --config configfile': 
  'stdout' - Contents of standard output produced by OpenVPN.
  'stderr' - Contents of standard error produced by OpenVPN.
```

## Possible conclusions

We can determine whether or not OpenVPN is able to bootstrap, according to its output.
We can determine whether or not a given URL is reachable via OpenVPN.

## Example output sample

  >many\nimportant segments of the population</a>, including whistle blowers,\njournalists,\
  \ Chinese dissidents skirting the Great Firewall and oppressive\ncensorship, abuse\
  \ victims, stalker targets, the US military, and law\nenforcement, just to name\
  \ a few.  While Tor is not designed for malicious\ncomputer users, it is true that\
  \ they can use the network for malicious ends.\nIn reality however, the actual amount\
  \ of <a\nhref=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq-abuse\">abuse</a> is quite low.\
  \ This\nis largely because criminals and hackers have significantly better access\
  \ to\nprivacy and anonymity than do the regular users whom they prey upon. Criminals\n\
  can and do <a\nhref=\"http://voices.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2008/08/web_fraud_20_tools.html\"\

  >more\npowerful networks</a> than Tor on a daily basis. Thus, in the mind of this\n\
  operator, the social need for easily accessible censorship-resistant private,\n\
  anonymous communication trumps the risk of unskilled bad actors, who are\nalmost\
  \ always more easily uncovered by traditional police work than by\nextensive monitoring\
  \ and surveillance anyway.</p>\n\n<p>\nIn terms of applicable law, the best way\
  \ to understand Tor is to consider it a\nnetwork of routers operating as common\
  \ carriers, much like the Internet\nbackbone. However, unlike the Internet backbone\
  \ routers, Tor routers\nexplicitly do not contain identifiable routing information\
  \ about the source of\na packet, and no single Tor node can determine both the origin\
  \ and destination\nof a given transmission.</p>\n\n<p>\nAs such, there is little\
  \ the operator of this router can do to help you track\nthe connection further.\
  \ This router maintains no logs of any of the Tor\ntraffic, so there is little that\
  \ can be done to trace either legitimate or\nillegitimate traffic (or to filter\
  \ one from the other).  Attempts to\nseize this router will accomplish nothing.</p>\n\
  \n<!-- FIXME: May or may not be US-only. Some non-US tor nodes have in\n     fact\
  \ reported DMCA harassment... -->\n\n<p>\nIf you are a representative of a company\
  \ who feels that this router is being\nused to violate the DMCA, please be aware\
  \ that this machine does not host or\ncontain any illegal content. Also be aware\
  \ that network infrastructure\nmaintainers are not liable for the type of content\
  \ that passes over their\nequipment, in accordance with <a\nhref=\"http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/512\"\
  >DMCA\n\"safe harbor\" provisions</a>. In other words, you will have just as much\
  \ luck\nsending a takedown notice to the Internet backbone providers. Please consult\n\

  \ about the router,  you may\nemail the <a href=\"mailto:tor@openvpnconfigfile.ie\">maintainer</a>.\
  \ If\ncomplaints are related to a particular service that is being abused, I will\n\
  consider removing that service from my exit policy, which would prevent my\nrouter\
  \ from allowing that traffic to exit through it. I can only do this on an\nIP+destination\
  \ port basis, however. Common P2P ports are\nalready blocked.</p>\n\n<p>\nYou also\
  \ have the option of blocking this IP address and others on\nthe Tor network if\
  \ you so desire. The Tor project provides a <a\nhref=\"https://check.torproject.org/cgi-bin/TorBulkExitList.py\"\
  >web service</a>\nto fetch a list of all IP addresses of Tor exit nodes that allow\
  \ exiting to a\nspecified IP:port combination, and an official <a\nhref=\"https://www.torproject.org/tordnsel/dist/\"\

## Expected Post-processing efforts

# Privacy considerations

OpenVPN does not seek to provide anonymity. 
An adversary can observe that a user is connecting to OpenVPN servers.
OpenVPN servers can also determine the users location.

# Packet capture considerations

This test does not capture packets by default.
