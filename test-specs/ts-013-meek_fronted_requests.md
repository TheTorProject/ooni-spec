# Specification name

Meek Fronted Request Test

# Test preconditions

* An internet connection

# Expected impact

Ability to detect uncensored fronted domains that can transmit requests to the
"inside" meek-server via an intermediary web service.

# Expected inputs

## Import document or import data format

A list of domain names (fronted domains) and host headers (meek-server) of the
intermediary web service.

## Semantics

The input document may contain a domain name and a host header combination per
line separated by colon in the format:

	DomainName:HostHeader

Example:

	www.google.com:meek-reflect.appspot.com
	a0.awsstatic.com:d2zfqthxsdq309.cloudfront.net

# Test description

Performs a HTTP GET request to a list of fronted domains with the Host
Header of the "inside" meek-server. The meek-server handles a GET request and
response with: "Iâ€™m just a happy little web server.\n".

# Expected output

## Parent data format

df-001-httpt-000

## Required output data

* The domain name and host header used in the measurement
	(DomainName:HostHeader)

* The requests that have been made

* The received responses

* If the meek request is blocked

## Semantics

censored:
	**boolean** indicates if an HTTP GET response to the meek server is
	successfull

## Possible conclusions

If the fronted request/response to the meek server is successful.
