# Specification name

  TCP Echo Test Helper

# Helper preconditions

  * An Internet connection
  * An Internet-Reachable TCP Port.

# Expected impact

  Ability to help an ooni-probe client determine if TCP payload has been
  modified in transit.

# Expected inputs

  Bytes received over TCP.

## Semantics

  TCP Echo helper listens on a TCP port and writes any bytes received back to
  the connected client. The implementation depends on
  twisted.internet.TCPServer and the TCP and lower protocols are therefore
  transparent to the helper.

# Helper description

 A TCP Echo service.

# Expected output

  Bytes received over TCP.

## Required output data
  
  All unmodified received bytes.

## Possible conclusions

  The TCP Echo test helper can be used by ooni-probe tests to determine if
  the TCP payload has been modified in transit.
