# OONI Partnership Consent Form

**Uncovering Evidence of Online Censorship Around the World**

This consent form outlines the roles, responsibilities and rights of partners
under the OONI Partnership Program, as well as the purpose, benefits, risks and
duration of the partnership.

## Partnership

This consent form establishes a partnership between the Open Observatory of
Network Interference (OONI) and

...............................................................................

## Purpose of the partnership

The aim of the partnership is to study network measurements and to increase
transparency and public awareness about online censorship and other forms of
network interference.

## Partnership requirements: Roles and Responsibilities

The roles and responsibilities of partners are outlined below. 

**Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI)**

Our role is primarily that of a *technical* partner and our responsibilities
towards you can include the following (depending on your role as a partner):

* **Technical support:** We will guide you through the entire process of using
OONI's software, whether that involves running ooniprobe from a computer or
setting up a Raspberry Pi to run ooniprobe (Lepidopter). We might also supply
you with Raspberry Pis and SD cards, which are already set-up with ooniprobe and
ready to be used for testing. Throughout the duration of the partnership, we
will provide you technical support in terms of using ooniprobe or Lepidopter.

* **Creating/Reviewing URL lists to test for online censorship:** We will
support you in terms of creating and/or reviewing (country-specific) URL lists
for testing online censorship throughout the duration of the partnership.

* **Communicating main findings:** We will support you in terms of communicating
the main findings from the collected measurements to the public. Such support
can include the writing of reports and blogs and, in some cases, the creation
of data visualizations.

We might also be able to support you in other additional ways, though this
can be evaluated on a case by case basis. 

**Partner**

Please select the following that applies to your **role** as part of the
partnership:

* [ ] NGO partner 

* [ ] Technical partner (e.g. hackerspace)

* [ ] Legal partner (e.g. legal association)

* [ ] Research partner (e.g. academic group)

* [ ] Media partner 

* [ ] Other (please specify:...........................................)

Based on your role, please select one or more of the following
**responsibilities** that you would like to have throughout the duration of the
partnership:

* [ ] Running network measurements (through ooniprobe or Lepidopter)

* [ ] Creating/Reviewing (country-specific) lists of URLs to test for online censorship

* [ ] Providing legal support to other OONI partners in your country 

* [ ] Providing legal analysis of collected measurements

* [ ] Reporting on the main findings of collected measurements

* [ ] Creating data visualizations based on the collected measurements

* [ ] Examining research questions based on the collected measurements

* [ ] Providing (socio-political) context to the measurements based on research

## Benefits

Throughout the duration of the partnership you will contribute to the study of
network measurements which can enhance your understanding of the prevalence,
breadth and depth of internet filtering in your country. Depending on your role
within the partnership, you can benefit from technical support by OONI, as well
as from support in other areas (such as communicating the main findings from the
study to the public, as outlined in the previous section).

## Risks

Participation in the OONI Partnership Program can potentially lead to various
legal and/or extra-legal risks, as explained in OONI's relevant
[documentation](https://github.com/TheTorProject/ooni-spec/blob/master/informed-consent/risks.md), which vary from country to country. In summary, such risks
might emerge through the use of OONI's network measurement software (if the use
of such software is illegal or viewed as a threat) and/or based on the URLs that
are tested for censorship (many of which might be viewed as controversial).
Legal and/or extra- legal risks might also potentially emerge once measurements
and findings are published. Please read the relevant documentation pertaining to
the description of [OONI's software tests](https://github.com/TheTorProject/ooni-spec/tree/master/test-descriptions) and associated
[risks](https://github.com/TheTorProject/ooni-spec/blob/master/informed-consent/risks.md). We also advise you to consult with lawyers, prior to engaging
as a partner.

Potential risks can be limited through the various
*[choices](https://github.com/TheTorProject/ooni-spec/blob/master/informed-consent/data-policy.md#opt-out)* that you can make. Specifically, you can choose
which tests to run, which URLs to test for censorship, which data to send to
OONI's measurement collector and whether you would like to have your collected
measurements published (and if so, how). Learn more through [OONI's Data
Policy](https://github.com/TheTorProject/ooni-spec/blob/master/informed-consent/data-policy.md#opt-out) and [test
descriptions](https://github.com/TheTorProject/ooni-spec/tree/master/test-descriptions), and please specify your choices to us.

OONI is *not* responsible and cannot be held liable for any consequences that
might emerge as a result of the partnership.

## Duration of partnership

The partnership between OONI and .......................... will last for a
duration of up to ............. months.

OONI may withdraw you from participating in this research if circumstances arise
which warrant doing so (if you do not carry out your responsibilities throughout
the duration of the partnership, as selected in this form). You can decide not
to take part in this partnership and if you do take part, you are free to
withdraw your consent and discontinue participation at any time.

## Your rights as a partner

Participation in this partnership is voluntary. You may choose to leave the
partnership at any time.

## Participation costs

There are no costs for participating in this partnership. Select partners will
be provided with Raspberry Pis and SD cards free of charge for the purpose of
running network measurements.

## Compensation

You will not receive compensation for participation in this partnership.
